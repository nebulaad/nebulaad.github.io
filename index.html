      <p>This is a dumping ground for stuff I make when I'm bored, things I like that I kind of drop off here like a nest, and whatever else. I mostly still think it's cool to have a personal website and my other web presence is either strictly portolio based or mildly social media adjacent, so I thought so long as the site was free, why not? This is pretty much a section just to talk to myself, but I've already decided that text looks nice here and so text is gunna go here.</p>
      <p>I like food, cooking, video games, crime documentaries (not sure what the difference is between regular old crime and true crime so either or, I guess), media analysis, dogs, anime, and the singular, breathtaking moment in the movie <i>Johnny Mnemonic</i> where you finally find out who Jones is. I think VR is cooler than it is annoying and more inaccessible than it is complicated, and every time I go to the grocery store I feel like smashing things to pieces with a baseball bat until people stop asking me to pay money for things.</p>
