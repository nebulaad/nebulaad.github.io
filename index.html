      <p>I just kind of wanted a private spot to throw up the stuff I do for fun, because most other things already have their place. The likelihood of someone besides me seeing this is minimal, but that's also kind of the point. I think everyone should have their own personal website to just piss around on, and then at least 10% of people would be like oh no for real social media is boring and no one ever really wanted their second cousins to know what they were up to because they don't care. I don't care. Why should anyone care?</p>
